Provide Feedback on Contributions
###############################################

As you read the contributions that other students and staff make to discussion
topics, you can provide feedback without writing a complete response or
comment. You can:

* :ref:`Vote for posts and responses<Vote for Posts or Responses>` to provide
  positive feedback.

* :ref:`Follow posts<Follow Posts>` so that you can check back in on
  interesting conversations and questions easily.

* :ref:`Answer questions, and mark your questions as answered<Answer
  Questions>`.

* :ref:`Report a contribution<Report Discussion Misuse>` that is inappropriate
  to the course staff.

To select a feedback option, you use the icons at the top right of each post,
response, or comment. When you move your cursor over these icons a label
appears.
